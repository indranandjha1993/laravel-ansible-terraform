; This is the configuration file for PHP.
; See /usr/lib/php/7.4/php.ini-development for more examples.

; PHP's syntax is very similar to that of Perl and C.

; Comments start with a semicolon and go to the end of the line.

; The php.ini file is searched for in these places in this order:
; 1. SAPI module specific location (PHPIniDir directive in Apache 2, for example).
; 2. The PHPRC environment variable.
; 3. A number of predefined registry keys on Windows.
; 4. Current working directory (except CLI).
; 5. The web server's directory (for SAPI modules), or directory of PHP (otherwise).
; 6. The directory from the --with-config-file-path compile time option, or the Windows directory (C:\windows or C:\winnt)
; See the PHP docs for more specific information.
